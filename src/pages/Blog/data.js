                  Hey hey! 🌟 Guess what? We’ve just launched this dope feature called Boom, and let
                  me tell you, it's a game-changer! 🚀 🚀 🚀
                </Text>

                <Text>
                  Okay so, Boom lets you shake or bump your phones to share contacts effortlessly
                  with one person, or groups – and get this – it works no matter what device anybody
                  has! No more struggling with manual adds, QR codes, searches, whatever, it's all
                  about that shake and share life now. 🤝✨
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We came up with this feature to make irl friending super easy. No more awkward
                  moments when you're trying to exchange contact info.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  And here's the kicker – you can use it to notify people when you're nearby. Like,
                  say you're at your fav hangout and your squad is nearby. Just give your phone a
                  little shake, and boom, they get a notification that you're in the area! 📍 Or
                  sneak up to peeps and shake your phone to let them know you’re nearby. No more
                  texting, "wya?"
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Peer is all about that seamless, on-the-fly connection. So, get with the times,
                  and let's shake it up! 📲💥

                  level up your social game: Live-Location Sharing! 📍📲
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Now you can seamlessly share your whereabouts with your ride-or-die crew, close

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  And it gets even better – we've added a slick group feature. Imagine this: you're
                  out with your squad, exploring the city or hitting up your fave spots. Just drop
                  everyone in a group and decide the level of privacy you're comfortable with. It's
                  like creating your own little VIP location-sharing party! 🎉🌍

                  We get it – you don't want your battery life taking a nosedive every time you
                  share your location. That's why our algorithm is on point, giving you accuracy
                  without turning your battery into a snack. 🚀🔋 We're all about saving that
                  battery life while keeping you connected. No more worrying about your phone dying
                  mid-adventure – we got your back! ⚡️

                  <br />
                  So, whether you're coordinating a meet-up, ensuring your besties make it to the
                  party, or just keeping tabs on your crew, Live-Location Sharing is the move. Stay
                  connected, stay chill, and let the good times roll! 🤙🗺️
