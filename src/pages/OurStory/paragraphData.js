magic without a wand? Or a lamp? Or the hero that wields it? Or simply a bottle of \
potion? That’s where the magic truly lies—it’s all about the story. AI, in many ways, is \
like magic—formless, all-powerful, all-encompassing, and full of potential. But for \
people to truly understand it, to make it a part of their lives, we need to transform it \
into something tangible, something they can see, use, and share. Just as all of \
humanity’s potential—and the magic we create—depends on the world we live in, AI needs \
its own world to realize its potential. At Peer, we’re dreaming of building that world.`,
