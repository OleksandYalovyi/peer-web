It shouldn’t be hard to find when and where things are happening these days. But it really is a huge problem! That’s why we’ve designed Zen around time and location. With Zen, you’ll always know when and where things are happening. Never miss another live concert, a block party, a McRib appearance, or some random event you never knew existed.`,

    content: `What we want doesn’t always match up to when we want it. Like what if you wanted to put something up for sale next week, but you have time to post it today- selling in the future. Is there even an app for that? There’s one now. Zen.`,

No other social experience lets you scroll horizontally and vertically. It’s liberating to go beyond the confinement of the screen. What wall, you ask? It’s the one you’re climbing every day and not realizing it. It’s altering how you think, how you behave, and what you believe in. It’s feeding you misinformation, mistrust, and fake news. This wall is your social feed and it’s so thick, so well engineered, and so invisible you never knew you were behind one. That’s because it’s a wall designed to shackle your mind. Sorry for the fumes but we’re really against what these walls are doing to people and the world at large.`,

    title: 'Total recall',
    content: `Zen provides a single source of truth across time and place—it is the ultimate contextual engine. You can think of Zen as a state machine that collects and maintains a visual state of the world at a given moment in time, past, present or future. Every 24hrs, information is written to an immutable ledger called the Peer Multi-Chain. Any change to information along the way will have a cryptographically verifiable tracking of the change. Zen is the best way to store, preserve, and view human knowledge.`,

    title: 'Almost time travel',
    content: `On Zen, you can literally time travel. Seriously, Zen lets you go to a specific point in time and a specific place to post. The best part is you can always return to that location and that’s where it’ll be. It may not sound impressive now, but when you’re looking for pictures of a friend’s Sweet 16, or your baby picture, or images of your grandparents when they were young, you’ll know you need this feature. It’s only here on Zen.`,

    title: 'Real teleportation',
    content: `The best way to be some place is to either be there in person, or in there in conversation. Zen lets you airdrop into the middle of social life, anywhere on Earth. It’ll be just like you’re there, because you’re actually there. You don’t need to be in Vietnam to immerse yourself in its culture. If you’re visiting a foreign location, it’ll be almost the real deal—you’ll understand the pictures, but not the words. Books and blogs have nothing on Zen. This isn’t just useful for observing a culture from afar, it’s really good for planning. So if you’re planning on traveling somewhere, Zen will let you be there to scope it out long before you can get there.`,
